## Hi there 👋

I'm Giulio, an italian **Mathematics** student at the University of Bari with a background in competitive robotics. 

🤖 Robotics & Projects

My journey started in high school robotics, and most of the public repos on my account are of a robotics project of some sort. These are my highlights:
  - [Remate](https://github.com/PabloVro006/Remate) - Smart-bin able to sort autonomously multiple waste at a time
  - [Taekwondo TS](https://github.com/Gyzmoooo/Taekwondo-TS) - Taekwondo data-taking device to help athletes improve in their fighting


🧠 Research Interests

I am currently diving deep into the mathematical foundations of Machine Learning.
My goal is to move past being a "user" of models and contribute to frontier-level research through a rigorous mathematical lens.


⚡Fun facts

  - I organize my life _exclusively_ on blank-pages diaries (I don't tolerate dot-grids or none of that crap).
  - I read roughly 80 books from [Geronimo Stilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geronimo_Stilton) when I was a kid.
  - When I'm not studying or working on something, I'm usually at the gym.
